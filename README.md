# Java Practice & Learning Repository
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/selvin-r/IDE-IN-JAVA)

This repository serves as a personal collection of Java code, documenting a learning journey through various programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving exercises. It includes solutions to challenges from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, implementations of fundamental computer science concepts, and small-scale application examples.

## Key Contents

### 📁 Core Java Concepts
- **OOP Principles:** Demonstrations of Encapsulation (`Encapsulation/`), Abstraction (`abstractt/`), and Polymorphism (`BalaSanCAD.java`).
- **Generics:** An example of a generic method working with `List<Number>` (`Generics.java`).
- **Bit Manipulation:** A comprehensive set of examples for bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, shifts) and their practical uses, such as checking for powers of two and swapping numbers (`BitManipulation.java`).
- **String Handling:** Various examples of string manipulation using `StringBuilder` (`StringBuliders.java`) and different reversing techniques (`ReversTypes.java`).
- **Data Structures:** Basic, from-scratch implementations of an `ArrayListt`, `Stack1`, and `hashSet`.

### 📈 Algorithms
- **Graph Traversal:** Implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) on a graph (`BFS.java`).
- **Sorting:** Manual implementations of Selection Sort (`SelectionSort.java`) and Merge Sort (`Sorting.java`).
- **Searching:** A recursive implementation of Binary Search (`Umamageswari.java`).
- **Recursion:** A collection of recursive solutions for problems like factorial, sum of numbers, and printing sequences (`Recursion.java`).

### 🧠 Problem Solving
- **LeetCode:** A large file containing solutions to numerous LeetCode problems, including:
  - `Rotate Image`
  - `Valid Sudoku` & `Sudoku Solver`
  - `Maximum Subarray` (Kadane's Algorithm)
  - `Climbing Stairs` (Dynamic Programming)
  - `Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation` (Stack-based)
  - `Longest Consecutive Sequence`
- **HackerRank:** Solutions to challenges like `Funny String` and `Hackerrank in a String` (`Hackerrank.java`).
- **Zoho Interview Questions:** Code for problems such as finding the longest sequence between two identical characters and computing max value from digit operations (`ZohoQustions.java`).
- **Daily Challenges:** A series of files (`DAY1` to `DAY6`) containing solutions to daily coding problems, covering matrix rotation, meeting room scheduling, string manipulation patterns, and more.

### 🛠️ Mini-Projects & Utilities
- **Bank Application:** A simple command-line interface (CLI) banking system that demonstrates account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking using OOP principles (`BankApplication/`).
- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** A classic, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game playable in the console (`TicTacToe.java`).
- **Matrix Operations:** Examples of matrix transpose and 90-degree rotation (`Matrixs.java`, `DAY1.java`).

## Getting Started

This repository is a collection of individual Java files. There is no central build file (`pom.xml` or `build.gradle`). To run a specific piece of code:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/selvin-r/ide-in-java.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the source directory:**
    ```sh
    cd ide-in-java/src
    ```
3.  **Compile the desired Java file.** For example, to compile the Tic-Tac-Toe game:
    ```sh
    javac TicTacToe.java
    ```
4.  **Run the compiled class:**
    ```sh
    java TicTacToe
    ```
    You can follow the same process for any other file containing a `main` method.
